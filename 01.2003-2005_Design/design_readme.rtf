These 3 designs are REALLY OLD.
When I started working for companies, back in 2003, I was both designing and developing. In general, I’m quite ashamed of everything that I designed (I guess that’s why I stopped doing it) and so I haven’t kept anything.

These three are just a sample of what I was doing back in 2005, in Valencia, Spain. Sites for small local business, government related pages, tourism portals, etc..

I don’t consider myself a graphic designer anymore, but if needed I can provide with other designs I’ve done in the past.
