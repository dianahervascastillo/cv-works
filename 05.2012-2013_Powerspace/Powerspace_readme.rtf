Powerspace
\b0  is an 
\b email advertising
\b0  company in Barcelona, Spain.\
\
The work in this company was a bit less challenging that I though it would be, although when it comes to be able to reach as much people as possible (meaning diverse email clients!) with email advertising\'85it can become quite challenging!\
\
I was mainly implementing all the email newsletters and offers for all our clients (Yves Rocher, Photobox, Edarling, Vistaprint\'85) as well as developing the landing pages for those campaigns.\
\
Strangely as it seems, I was doing responsive (good looking) emails (although we\'92ve always been able to do do that, somehow\'85) and so I made the landing pages responsive too.\
\
Still using sass (scss notation), html, loads of in style css for the emails (tricks here and there), and some js for the landing pages.\
\
\
Some AMAZING emails ( I know, is boring\'85)\

\
(these two had some cool dynamic stuff as a location map or different images depending on the campaign targeting)\

\
I\'92ve included some images for a few landing campaigns too, but i\'92m afraid those are not online anymore.\
\
Also, I\'92ve attached the super quick site I made for the company. Me and the designer came up with something easy to implement, so there\'92s not much fancy stuff there. Some css3, hopefully a clean markup and not much js.\
